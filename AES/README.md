## AES - Advanced Encryption Standard

The AES algorithm is a symmetric-key cipher that can encrypt and decrypt information.

"AES encryption is capable of using cryptographic keys of 128, 192, and 256 bits to encrypt and decrypt data in blocks of 128 bits." - NIST

To give you a good idea of keys of 128 bits or more, consider that on average, breaking a 40-bit key at a cost of $100,000 takes an estimated total time of two seconds. However, if we have a 128-bit key and spend $10 trillion on resources to break it, we would have an estimated total time of ten to the power of eleven (10ยนยน) years to break it. Pretty impressive, right?

The Advanced Encryption Standard operates on a 4x4 array. Its main characteristics include security, performance, ease of implementation, flexibility, and it requires little memory.
